# @graphql-hive/router-query-planner changelog
## 0.0.34 (2026-06-18)

### Fixes

#### Improve handling of unions

The query planner improves handling of union types whose members vary between subgraphs. Previously, the planner always computed an intersection of union members, ignoring subgraph-specific members.

Fixes [#1098](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1098)

## 0.0.33 (2026-06-17)

### Fixes

#### Add an experimental query planner option, `experimental_abstract_type_folding`

```yaml
query_planner:
    experimental_abstract_type_folding: true # false by default
```

Folds matching concrete object-type fragments in subgraph calls, into a shared interface fragment even when that interface is not the field's declared return type.

It's an opt-in addition to [`011be5b`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/commit/011be5bdbfb00bf1e415eb7a50e6be91f565ef05).

```diff
## queries `product-service` subgraph
query {
  products {
-    ... on Book  { id title }
-    ... on Movie { id title }
+    ... on Media { id title }
  }
}
```

The `products` field returns `Product` interface, but one object-type member of this interface called `Album` is not present in the query, therefore `... on Product {...}` is not possible to use (default behavior). With the feature flag enabled, both fragments are folded into `... on Media { ... }`, because `Book` and `Movie` are the only members of the `Media` interface in the `product-service` subgraph.

#### Avoid indirect lookup for directly resolved leaf fields

The planner now skips indirect path lookup when a leaf field already has a valid direct path.

## 0.0.32 (2026-06-16)

### Fixes

#### Fix union list FieldMove creation

In some cases union list was treated as single union field in graph.

## 0.0.31 (2026-06-15)

### Fixes

#### Demand Control with `@cost` and `@listSize` directives

Add support for the [Demand Control specification](https://ibm.github.io/graphql-specs/cost-spec.html), allowing operators to limit the cost of incoming GraphQL operations using the `@cost` and `@listSize` directives.

The router now calculates the cost of incoming operations based on directive-driven type, field, and argument costs (with list-size estimation) and can reject operations that exceed a configured maximum. Both static (request) and actual (response) cost can be measured, and the behavior is configurable via the new `demand_control` section in the router configuration.

Telemetry is included: new metrics under `demand_control_metrics` and additional span attributes expose estimated/actual cost and rejection reasons for observability.

[Documentation for the feature is available here](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/security/demand-control)

## 0.0.30 (2026-06-13)

### Fixes

#### Fold repeated object-type selections into a single interface selection

When a `Fetch` node asks for the same fields on different object types, and all
of those types implement the same interface that matches the field's return type,
the query planner now merges them into a single inline fragment on the interface
instead of keeping separate branches.

For example: `query { media { ... on Book { id title } ... on Movie { id title } } }` becomes
`query { media { id title } }` when the field's return type is `Media` and both
`Book` and `Movie` implement it in the subgraph.

## 0.0.29 (2026-06-03)

### Fixes

#### Forward operation name to subgraphs

Added the `traffic_shaping.all.forward_operation_name` and `traffic_shaping.subgraphs.<name>.forward_operation_name` options. The option defaults to `false`.

The operation name is injected (opt-in) into the query document and the `operationName` JSON field, formatted as `<client_operation_name>__<fetch_step_id>`, when sending requests to subgraphs.

Global opt-in:

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    forward_operation_name: true
```

Per-subgraph opt-in:

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  subgraphs:
    products:
      # Overrides global setting for this subgraph
      forward_operation_name: true
```

## 0.0.28 (2026-05-27)

### Fixes

#### Fix `VariablesInAllowedPosition` rejecting list-typed variables with a non-null default value

The router used to reject valid client queries that declared a list-typed variable with a non-null default value, for example:

```graphql
query Q($arg: [SomeEnum!] = SOME_VALUE) {
  field(arg: $arg)
}
```

with a `VariablesInAllowedPosition` validation error containing a malformed type:

```
Variable "$arg" of type "SomeEnum!!" used in position expecting type "[SomeEnum!]".
```

The rule used to compute the variable's effective type incorrectly when the variable was list-typed and had a non-null default value: it dropped the list wrapper and re-wrapped the inner element type in `NonNull`, producing the invalid `T!!` shape. Per [the spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-All-Variable-Usages-are-Allowed), a non-null default value makes the variable usable in a non-null position; the variable's effective type should be `NonNull(var_type)`, not `NonNull(element_type)`. So for `[SomeEnum!]` with a non-null default, the effective type is now correctly `[SomeEnum!]!` (and the query is accepted).

## 0.0.27 (2026-05-11)

### Fixes

#### Escape inline string arguments when emitting subgraph operations

Fixes a bug where string values inlined as arguments in subgraph operations were not re-escaped per the GraphQL spec. When an incoming operation contained a string literal whose decoded value carried a quote or backslash (for example `payload: "\"quoted\""`), the router forwarded the argument to the subgraph as `payload: ""quoted""`, producing invalid GraphQL. The same went for newlines, tabs, and other control characters.

Now the characters are escaped properly per the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#StringCharacter).

## 0.0.26 (2026-05-11)

### Fixes

#### Preserve custom scalars as raw JSON

Custom scalar fields marked by the query planner are now preserved as raw JSON instead of being parsed and rebuilt as structured response values. This improves correctness for JSON passthrough custom scalars while avoiding performance regressions for normal response handling.

## 0.0.25 (2026-05-08)

### Features

#### Fix conditional directive handling in response projection.

This fixes several edge cases where `@skip` and `@include` could produce an incorrect final response after query planning and projection planning.

## 0.0.24 (2026-05-05)

### Fixes

- Adjustments in operation's kind being Enum and not &'static str

#### Added missing `isRepeatable` on `type __Directive`

The router's introspection schema was resolving `isRepeatable`, but it did not appear in the public (consumer) schema, leading to validation errors when introspection schema was executed through Laboratory. 

This change adds the missing `isRepeatable: Boolean!` to `type __Directive`, according to the [GraphQL introspection spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/spec/Section%204%20--%20Introspection.md).

#### Avoid propagating `@include`/`@skip` conditions to unconditional fetches

Fixed query planner condition propagation logic to avoid wrapping unconditional fetches
in conditional blocks when merging steps. This ensures that fields without directives are
not incorrectly gated by conditions from other steps, allowing for correct execution of
queries with mixed conditional and unconditional selections.

#### Fix fragments being dropped when multiple inline fragments target the same concrete type within an abstract type fragment.

Previously, when a query contained two or more inline fragments on the same concrete type nested inside an interface or union fragment, only the first fragment's fields were included in the query plan — all subsequent ones were silently dropped.

**Example query that previously returned only `title`:**

```graphql
query {
  films {
    ... on Node {
      ... on Film { title }
      ... on Film { director }
    }
  }
}
```

Both fields are now correctly returned.

#### Fix fragment handling

Fix fragment handling for some queries that use reusable fragments with conditional directives

## 0.0.23 (2026-04-20)

### Fixes

#### Fix query planner handling for combined `@skip` and `@include` conditions.

- Preserve both directives when converting inline fragment conditions into fetch step selections
- Build the expected nested condition nodes for combined skip/include execution paths
- Handle `SkipAndInclude` in selection matching, fetch-step rendering, and multi-type batch path hashing
- Add regression snapshot tests for field-level and fragment-level combined conditions

For example a query like this:

```graphql
query($skip: Boolean!, $include: Boolean!) {
  user {
    name @skip(if: $skip) @include(if: $include)
  }
}
```

Will now correctly generate a fetch step with an inline fragment that has both `@skip` and `@include` conditions, and the planner will properly evaluate the combined conditions when determining which selections to include in the execution plan.

- `@skip(if: $skip)` is true, the selection will be skipped regardless of the `@include` condition.
- `@include(if: $include)` is false, the selection will be skipped regardless of the `@skip` condition.
- Only if `@skip(if: $skip)` is false and `@include(if: $include)` is true, the selection will be included in the execution plan.

## 0.0.22 (2026-04-15)

### Fixes

- Fix `Subscription.primary` type to `FetchNode` instead of `PlanNode` in the distributed `index.d.ts` file.

## 0.0.21 (2026-04-15)

### Fixes

#### `Subscription` node's `primary` is `FetchNode` instead of `PlanNode` now, but the types were not compatible.

This change updates the type of `Subscription.primary` to be `FetchNode` instead of `PlanNode`.

## 0.0.20 (2026-04-15)

### Features

#### Query Plan Subscriptions Node

The query planner now emits a `Subscription` node when planning a subscription operation. The `Subscription` node contains a `primary` fetch that is sent to the subgraph owning the subscription field.

## 0.0.19 (2026-04-15)

### Features

#### Query Plan Subscriptions Node

The query planner now emits a `Subscription` node when planning a subscription operation. The `Subscription` node contains a `primary` fetch that is sent to the subgraph owning the subscription field.

## 0.0.18 (2026-04-13)

### Fixes

#### Fix planning for conditional inline fragments and field conditions

Fixed a query-planner bug where directive-only inline fragments (using `@include`/`@skip` without an explicit type condition) could fail during normalization/planning for deeply nested operations.

This update improves planner handling for conditional selections and adds regression tests to prevent these failures in the future.

## 0.0.17 (2026-04-01)

### Fixes

- This patch includes the fixes in the query planner including the fixes for mismatch handling so conflicting fields are tracked by response key (alias-aware), and internal alias rewrites restore the original client-facing key (alias-or-name) instead of always the schema field name.

## 0.0.16 (2026-03-16)

### Fixes

- Add missing `*.node` binaries to the `dist` folder in the distributed package.

## 0.0.15 (2026-03-16)

### Features

- progressive override (#856)

#### Introduce BatchFetch for compatible entity fetches to improve query performance

When multiple `Flatten(Fetch)` steps target the same subgraph and have compatible shape, the planner can group them into one batched fetch operation with aliases.

Batching keeps execution depth the same, but **reduces request fanout**.
In our benchmark query, **downstream requests drop from `13` to `7`** while the number of execution waves stays unchanged.
This should also reduce pressure on subgraphs, because entities are resolved in one batched subgraph call instead of being resolved across multiple incoming GraphQL requests, where the lack of DataLoader or another caching layer could otherwise cause duplicate resolution work.

Before: 

```graphql
Parallel {
  Flatten(path: "products.@") {
    Fetch(service: "inventory") {
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      } =>
      {
        ... on Product {
          shippingEstimate
        }
      }
    }
  }
  Flatten(path: "topProducts.@") {
    Fetch(service: "inventory") {
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      } =>
      {
        ... on Product {
          shippingEstimate
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After:

```graphql
BatchFetch(service: "inventory") {
  {
    _e0 {
      paths: [
        "products.@"
        "topProducts.@"
      ]
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      }
    }
  }
  {
    _e0: _entities(representations: $__batch_reps_0) {
      ... on Product {
        shippingEstimate
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When two entity fetches go to the same subgraph but request different output fields, they are batched into one `BatchFetch` node with two aliases, but share the same variables, to reduce the payload size.

```
BatchFetch(service: "inventory") {
  {
    _e0 {
      paths: [
        "products.@"
      ]
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      }
    }
    _e1 {
      paths: [
        "products.@"
      ]
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      }
    }
  }
  {
    _e0: _entities(representations: $__batch_reps_0) {
      ... on Product {
        shippingEstimate
      }
    }
    _e1: _entities(representations: $__batch_reps_0) {
      ... on Product {
        inStock
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Public API Changes

### Progressive Override support in `QueryPlanner.plan`

Now `QueryPlanner.plan` accepts two additional parameters: `activeLabels` and `percentageValue`. These parameters are used to determine which overrides should be applied when generating the query plan. The `activeLabels` parameter is a set of labels that are currently active, and the `percentageValue` parameter is a number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of traffic that should be routed to the overrides.

### `AbortSignal` support in `QueryPlanner.plan`

The `QueryPlanner.plan` method now also accepts an optional `signal` parameter of type `AbortSignal`. This allows the caller to abort the query planning process if it takes too long or if the user cancels the operation. If the signal is aborted, the `plan` method will throw an error.

### `overrideLabels` and `overridePercentages` getters

Two new getters have been added to the `QueryPlanner` class: `overrideLabels` and `overridePercentages`. The `overrideLabels` getter returns a set of all the labels that are defined in the planner's supergraph, while the `overridePercentages` getter returns an array of all the percentage values that are defined in the planner's supergraph. These getters can be used by the caller to determine which overrides are available and how they are configured.

### `QueryPlanner.plan` is no longer a `Promise`

The `QueryPlanner.plan` method is now a synchronous method that returns a `QueryPlan` directly, instead of returning a `Promise`. This change was made to simplify the API and to allow for better error handling. If the query planning process encounters an error, it will throw an exception that can be caught by the caller.

### `QueryPlanner.planAsync` is now a `Promise`

The `QueryPlanner.planAsync` method is now an asynchronous method that returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `QueryPlan`. This method is intended for use cases where the query planning process may take a long time, and the caller wants to avoid blocking the main thread. The `planAsync` method accepts the same parameters as the `plan` method, including the new `activeLabels`, `percentageValue`, and `signal` parameters.

### `QueryPlanner` constructor now uses `safe_parse_schema`

The `QueryPlanner` constructor now uses the `safe_parse_schema` function to parse the supergraph SDL. This function is a safer alternative to the previous parsing method, as it returns a `Result` that can be handled gracefully in case of parsing errors. If the SDL cannot be parsed, the constructor will return an error instead of panicking.

## Implementation changes

- The `QueryPlanner` struct now holds a `Planner` instance directly, instead of an `Arc<Planner>`. This change was made to simplify the internal implementation and to avoid unnecessary reference counting. Since the `QueryPlanner` is not designed to be shared across threads, there is no need for the additional overhead of an `Arc`.

- `AbortSignal` and `CancellationToken` integration to give the ability to cancel the query planning process to the Node addon consumer.

- `QueryPlanner.planAsync` is introduced with [`AsyncTask`](https://napi.rs/docs/concepts/async-tasks) to allow for non-blocking query planning in the Node addon.

## 0.0.14 (2026-03-12)

### Features

#### Metrics with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus

This release adds support for OpenTelemetry metrics. In addition to existing tracing support, the router can now collect detailed metrics about HTTP and GraphQL activity and export them to a Prometheus endpoint or to an OTLP collector.

- Telemetry configuration now has a `metrics` section. Users can enable metrics exporters and tune histogram buckets under `telemetry.metrics` in `router.config.yaml`. By default metrics are disabled, so existing configurations continue to work unchanged.
- **Prometheus exporter** exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that follows the standard Prometheus text format. It can be attached to Router's http server or run on its own port. 
- **OTLP exporter** is available for sending metrics to an OpenTelemetry collector via gRPC or HTTP.
- **Instrumentation for every stage of the pipeline** - parsing, normalization, validation, planning and execution.
- **HTTP client/server metrics** - Router records metrics for incoming HTTP requests (latencies, sizes and status codes) and for outbound subgraph requests. These instruments follow the OpenTelemetry HTTP semantic conventions, making them usable out‑of‑the‑box with observability backends.
- **Supergraph reload metrics** - polling and reloading the supergraph is measured with poll counts, durations and errors, giving visibility into slow or failed schema reloads.

**Example configuration**

```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    exporters:
      - prometheus:
          enabled: true
          # optional custom path (default `/metrics`)
          path: /metrics
          # serve on this port
          port: 9090
      - otlp:
          enabled: true
          # An absolute path to the OpenTelemetry collector
          endpoint: "http://otel-collector:4317"
          # protocol can be `grpc` or `http`
          protocol: http
    instrumentation:
      instruments:
        # Disable HTTP server request duration metric
        http.server.request.duration: false
        http.client.request.duration:
          attributes:
            # Disable the label
            graphql.operation.name: false
```

Visit ["OpenTelemetry Metrics" documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/observability/metrics) for more details on configuring metrics and exporters.

## 0.0.13 (2026-03-05)

### Features

#### Improve Query Plans for abstract types

The query planner now combines fetches for multiple matching types into a single fetch step.
Before, the planner could create one fetch per type.
Now, it can fetch many types together when possible, which reduces duplicate fetches and makes query plans more efficient.

#### Rename internal query-plan path segment from `Cast(String)` to `TypeCondition(Vec<String>)`

Query Plan shape changed from `Cast(String)` to `TypeCondition(Vec<String>)`.
The `TypeCondition` name better reflects GraphQL semantics (`... on Type`) and avoids string encoding/decoding like `"A|B"` in planner/executor code.

**What changed**
- Query planner path model now uses `TypeCondition` terminology instead of `Cast`.
- Type conditions are represented as a list of type names, not a pipe-delimited string.
- Node addon query-plan typings were updated accordingly:
  - `FetchNodePathSegment.TypenameEquals` now uses `string[]`
  - `FlattenNodePathSegment` now uses `TypeCondition: string[]` (instead of `Cast: string`)

## 0.0.12 (2026-02-06)

### Features

- Operation Complexity - Limit Aliases (#746)
- Operation Complexity - Limit Aliases (#749)

## 0.0.11 (2026-01-22)

### Fixes

#### Refactor Parse Error Handling in `graphql-tools`

Breaking;
- `ParseError(String)` is now `ParseError(InternalError<'static>)`.
- - So that the internals of the error can be better structured and more informative, such as including line and column information.
- `ParseError`s are no longer prefixed with "query parse error: " in their Display implementation.

## 0.0.10 (2026-01-14)

### Fixes

#### Moves `graphql-tools` to router repository

This change moves the `graphql-tools` package to the Hive Router repository.

## Own GraphQL Parser

This change also introduces our own GraphQL parser (copy of `graphql_parser`), which is now used across all packages in the Hive Router monorepo. This allows us to have better control over parsing and potentially optimize it for our specific use cases.

## 0.0.9 (2025-12-11)

### Fixes

- chore: Enable publishing of internal crate

## 0.0.8 (2025-12-11)

### Fixes

#### Prevent planner failure when combining conditional directives and interfaces

Fixed a bug where the query planner failed to handle the combination of conditional directives (`@include`/`@skip`) and the automatic `__typename` injection required for abstract types.

## 0.0.7 (2025-12-08)

### Fixes

- Bump dependencies

## 0.0.6 (2025-11-28)

### Fixes

## 0.0.4 (2025-11-24)

### Fixes

#### Avoid extra `query` prefix for anonymous queries

When there is no variable definitions and no operation name, GraphQL queries can be sent without the `query` prefix. For example, instead of sending:

```diff
- query {
+ {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
  }
}
```

## 0.0.3 (2025-11-06)

### Fixes

## 0.0.2 (2025-11-05)

### Features

#### A node addon containing the query planner of hive router

To use in TypeScript, you would go ahead and do something like:

```ts
import {
  QueryPlanner,
  type QueryPlan,
} from "@graphql-hive/router-query-planner";

const supergraphSdl = "<your sdl from file or in code>";

const qp = new QueryPlanner(supergraphSdl);

const plan: QueryPlan = qp.plan(/* GraphQL */ `
  {
    posts {
      title
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
`);

// see QueryPlan types in lib/node-addon/src/query-plan.d.ts
```

which will generate you a [Query Plan used in Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/reference/query-plans).

Hive Gateway uses it as an alternative federation query planner in the [`@graphql-hive/router-runtime`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/blob/main/packages/router-runtime).

To use in with Hive Gateway, you first install the runtime

```sh
npm i @graphql-hive/router-runtime
```

```ts
// gateway.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@graphql-hive/gateway";
import { unifiedGraphHandler } from "@graphql-hive/router-runtime";

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  unifiedGraphHandler,
});
```
